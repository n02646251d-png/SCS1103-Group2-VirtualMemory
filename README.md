## Research question

On a low-memory server replaying the Azure Functions 2021 trace, which page replacement policy (FIFO, LRU or Clock) causes the fewest page faults at the same RAM size?

## Aim

To compare FIFO(First In ,First Out), LRU (Least Recently Used) and Clock page replacement on a real serverless workload, and find out which one keeps the most useful functions in a limited amount of RAM.

## Objectives

1. Build a Python simulator that replays a list of function calls through FIFO, LRU and Clock with a fixed number of RAM slots.
2. Run all three policies on the Azure Functions 2021 trace, treating each function as a page and each invocation as a page request, at RAM sizes of 1%,5%,10% and 25% of the distinct functions in the data.
3. Evaluate by measuring the page-fault rate (faults ÷ invocations) and the hit rate (hits ÷ invocations) at each RAM size, with FIFO as the baseline. A policy succeeds if it cuts the fault rate by at least 10% (relative to FIFO) at 3 or more of the 4 RAM sizes. The best policy is the one that succeeds and has the lowest average fault rate.
